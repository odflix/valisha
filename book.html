Your kind words, gentle smile, and the way you brighten my days have earned a place in my heart. I never expected to fall for the girl I had always known, but now I can’t imagine life without you.

Maybe it was fate, or maybe it was simply the way our lives intertwined—but whatever it was, I’m grateful it brought me to you. 💕
